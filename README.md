# Pose Tracking

This is the repository containing everything related to "Pose Tracking" project
for my research stay in Gunnar Blohm's Lab in Kingston.

I want to improve performance of pose tracking by combining (deep) pose extraction
algorithms with the variational coupled Gaussian process dynamical model.
